Learn meters, decimeters, and centimeters through a perceptual way. Encode it in a 6,000-word suspense detective novel.
This requires conceiving the outline of the novel, with a lot of twists and turns. There should be 30+ applications of meters, decimeters, and centimeters in total.
The topics include detective, suspense, horror, secret love, elementary school students, experiments, and docks.
