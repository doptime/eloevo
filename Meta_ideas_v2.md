# Meta Ideas: Dual Model Iterative Reasoning
> https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03314v1
## Core Concept

Two language models collaboratively solve problems through structured iterative reasoning, optimizing test-time compute allocation.

## Key Components

1. Compute-optimal scaling: Adapt test-time compute strategy based on problem difficulty.
2. Dual approaches: 
   a) Refining proposal distribution (revisions)
   b) Optimizing verifier-based search
3. Difficulty estimation: Use model performance to bin problems into difficulty levels.
4. Adaptive allocation: Balance sequential (revisions) and parallel (search) compute based on difficulty.
5. Convergence mechanism: Process terminates when solution quality stabilizes or compute budget is exhausted.

## Implementation Steps

1. Train revision model:
   - Generate training data with correlated incorrect and correct answers
   - Finetune model to produce sequential revisions

2. Train verifier model:
   - Implement process reward model (PRM) for step-wise scoring
   - Train PRM using Monte Carlo rollouts for supervision

3. Implement search algorithms:
   - Best-of-N weighted
   - Beam search
   - Lookahead search

4. Difficulty estimation:
   - Bin problems based on base model pass@1 rate
   - Implement model-predicted difficulty using PRM scores

5. Compute-optimal scaling:
   - For each difficulty bin, determine optimal:
     a) Ratio of sequential to parallel compute
     b) Search algorithm and parameters

6. Main reasoning loop:
   - Estimate problem difficulty
   - Select compute-optimal strategy
   - Alternate between revisions and search until convergence or budget exhausted
   - Return best solution found

## Evaluation

- Compare compute-optimal scaling to baselines (e.g., best-of-N)
- Analyze performance across difficulty bins
- Conduct FLOPs-matched comparison with larger pretrained models


## Implementation Notes

- Use cross-validation when tuning compute-optimal strategies
- Implement efficient caching and reuse of computations where possible
- Consider trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in compute allocation
- Monitor and analyze failure cases to guide further improvements

By following this structure, we can implement a Dual Model Iterative Reasoning system that adapts its test-time compute strategy based on problem difficulty, potentially achieving better performance than static approaches or even larger pretrained models in some scenarios.

# Prompt Template for Dual Model Iterative Reasoning

You are an AI assistant participating in a dual model iterative reasoning process. You will be working with another AI model to solve complex problems through structured collaboration. Follow these steps:

1. Problem Analysis:
Analyze the given problem. Identify key components, constraints, and potential approaches.

2. Initial Proposal:
Provide an initial solution or approach to the problem. Be detailed and explain your reasoning.

3. Difficulty Estimation:
Estimate the difficulty of this problem on a scale of 1-5, where:
1 = Very Easy
2 = Easy
3 = Moderate
4 = Difficult
5 = Very Difficult
Explain your reasoning for this estimation.

4. Compute Strategy Selection:
Based on the difficulty, recommend a compute strategy:
- For easier problems (1-2): Suggest more sequential revisions
- For moderate problems (3): Suggest a balanced approach of revisions and parallel search
- For harder problems (4-5): Suggest more parallel search with some revisions

5. Solution Refinement:
If revising:
- Identify potential improvements or flaws in the current solution
- Propose specific changes or additions

If searching:
- Propose alternative approaches or solutions
- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each

6. Verification:
Score the current solution or proposed alternatives on a scale of -1 to 1:
-1 = Incorrect or significantly flawed
0 = Partially correct but needs improvement
1 = Correct and well-reasoned
Explain your scoring reasoning.

7. Convergence Check:
Assess whether the solution has converged:
- Has the solution quality stabilized?
- Are we seeing diminishing returns from further iterations?
- Have we exhausted the allocated compute budget?

If not converged, recommend the next step (further revision or search). If converged, summarize the final solution and key insights gained through the process.

8. Meta-Analysis:
Reflect on the reasoning process:
- What strategies were most effective?
- Where did we struggle or make breakthroughs?
- How could we improve this process for similar problems in the future?

Remember:
- Be clear and detailed in your explanations
- Consider multiple perspectives and approaches
- Adapt your strategy based on the problem difficulty and progress made
- Aim for continuous improvement throughout the process
