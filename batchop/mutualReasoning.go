// Problem: [insert specific problem]

// Previous solution 1:
// [insert preSolution1]

// Previous solution 2:
// [insert preSolution2]

// Please follow the steps below to perform dual-model iterative reasoning:

// 1. Evaluate previous solutions:
// Score the two previous solutions (1-10 points) and briefly explain the reasons for the scores. Point out the advantages and disadvantages of each solution.

// 2. Comprehensive analysis:
// Compare the two solutions and find out their similarities and differences. Analyze the possible impact of these differences.

// 3. Propose improvements:
// Based on the above analysis, propose 2-3 possible improvement directions. These improvements should absorb the advantages of the two solutions and try to make up for their shortcomings.

// 4. Generate a new solution:
// Combine the advantages of the previous solution and the improvements you proposed to generate a new comprehensive solution.

// 5. Self-evaluation:
// Self-evaluate the newly generated solution and point out its advantages and possible problems.

// 6. Iterative optimization:
// Based on the results of the self-evaluation, further optimize the solution. If there are still obvious problems, return to step 3 to continue to improve.

// Please repeat the above steps until you reach the specified iteration depth or get a satisfactory answer.

// Throughout the process, please pay attention to:
// - Keep objective and fair evaluation of each solution
// - Actively look for synergies between different solutions
// - Continue to focus on the core of the problem and avoid deviating from the topic
// - Be bold and innovative while retaining the advantages of the original solution

// Finally, summarize the entire reasoning process, explain how the new solution integrates and improves the previous solution, and give the final recommendation.

// ## Step 1: Reasoning to Make revisions to the previous Problem Reformulated:
// 	Evaluate Problem Reformulation (step 1.2 in previous solutions) and make revisions (if applicable)
// 		- Holistic Problem Exploration revisions:
// 			- Analyze the given problem from multiple perspectives.
// 			- Identify potential underlying issues or broader contexts that may not be immediately apparent.
// 			- Consider various stakeholders and their potential concerns.
// 		- Intent Discovery:
// 			- Probe deeper into the possible motivations behind the question.
// 			- Identify implicit assumptions or biases in the problem statement.
// 			- Consider how different framings of the problem might lead to different solutions.
// 		- Key Factors Identification:
// 			- List critical factors that may influence the problem's solution.

// ## Step 2: ** Problem Reformulated ** (Iteration previous Problem Reformulation if applicable, improve according to the above analysis):
// 	- Provide the Context of the problem.
// 	- State the Condition/Constraints of the problem.
// 	- Present a reformulated problem statement (problem to solve) that captures its essence more accurately.

// ## Step 3: reasoing to make revisions to the previous step-by-stey solutions (Chain of Thought)
// 	Now Fork on the best solution in previous solutions to make revisions:
// 	- Evaluate the weaknesses of the solution plan in previous solution step.
// 	- reasoing to Add or remove steps in the solution plan.
// 	- reasoning to unfold one step further in the solution step.
// 	- reasoning to fold one step back in the solution step.
// 	- reasoning to reasnwer the subquestion in the solution step.
// 	- reasoning to rephrase the question or subquestion in the solution step.
// 	- Throughout the process, please pay attention to:
// 		- Keep objective and fair evaluation of each solution
// 		- Actively look for synergies between different solutions
// 		- Continue to focus on the core of the problem and avoid deviating from the topic
// 		- Be bold and innovative while retaining the advantages of the original solution

// ## Step 4: ** Generate Final step-by-step solution ** (Chain of Thought) :
// 	- Iteration to improve the best solution in previous solutions if applicable
//  	- Based on the above analysis, write out the full step-by-step solution plan for the problem.
// 	- before unfolding a step. explain the plan of the step in the leading sentence. (e.g. "Step 1: First, I will ...", "Step 2: Next, I will ...")

// ## Step 5: Problem Solved Reasoning:
// 	-Reasoning whether the original problem is perfectly solved by the generated solution above (No more improvement Needed)
// 	-conclusion: { solved: <true or false>}
